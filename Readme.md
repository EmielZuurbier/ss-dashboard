Dashboard app to visualize data from celltowers  
This repo contains the build of the project.

## Intro
The smartsensors dashboard is a visualization tool to see the data created from Celltower data. This data contains information about the signal strength, type of signal, type of tower and location.

The platform is built on a Express server with a MongoDB database. The data is collected through Mozilla, OpenCell and user generated data. All these points of data are marked on a map.
